<h1>Introduction</h1>
This Lab is meant to be a simple illustration of how to set up a VPN for the purpose of viewing content only available in other geographic locations.When browsing the internet many sites and services give you pre selected content based on where you are located. Your IP address is unique to your network and like a street address shows a geographical location. This is not always Ideal as we may not have access to certain content. Thus at times it may be necessary to change our IP address and its attached geographic location. One way to change the appearance of our IP address when using the internet is a VPN. A VPN is a service that redirects your internet traffic through a server in another location to mask your original location.

With this IP address when we browse the internet we will be given content aimed at the US, but what if we would like to see content for another country?
That is where a VPN comes in. With a VPN we can appear to be in the location of whatever proxy server we choose. 

- Step 2: Browse to your streaming service of choice for the sake of this lab we will use Netflix as an example. As was stated before Netflix is showing content for the US audience due to the fact we have a US based IP address.

As you can see you now have access to content for the Japanese audience. This is due to the fact that you are running your internet traffic through a Japan based server via proton VPN. This process can be replicated for any Location provided by the VPN service as your IP address is what websites use to track your location.
